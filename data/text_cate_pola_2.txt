However, in the summer of 2003, it seems the management has changed and the great big door has been replaced for a glass front ridding itself of the dark romantic getup.####[['service', 'neutral'], ['ambience', 'disappointed']]
We won't go to this place again for a good meal.####[['food', 'angry']]
It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.####[['ambience', 'neutral']]
Barbecued codfish was gorgeously moist - as if poached - yet the fabulous texture was let down by curiously bland seasoning - a spice rub might have overwhelmed, however herb mix or other sauce would have done much to enhance.####[['food', 'neutral']]

And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.####[['food', 'approval']]
The sauces used are also not that exciting.####[['food', 'disappointed']]
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.####[['food', 'approval']]

My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.####[['food', 'approval']]
